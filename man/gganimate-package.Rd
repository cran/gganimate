\title{gganimate: A Grammar of Animated Graphics}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right'}}

The grammar of graphics as implemented in the 'ggplot2' package has
    been successful in providing a powerful API for creating static 
    visualisation. In order to extend the API for animated graphics this package
    provides a completely new set of grammar, fully compatible with 'ggplot2' 
    for specifying transitions and animations in a flexible and extensible way.
}
\section{Good starting points}{

The \code{\link[=animate]{animate()}} function documentation describes how to specify how the
animation is rendered, whereas the documentation for the different transition
functions, e.g. \code{\link[=transition_states]{transition_states()}}, describe how to declare the animation.

Both \code{\link[=ease_aes]{ease_aes()}} and the different \link[=enter_exit]{enter and exit} functions
are good to understand in order to modify tweening of the animation.

Apart from the included documentation there is also a few web ressources
worth mentioning:
\itemize{
\item The \href{https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate/wiki}{gganimate wiki} includes
user supplied example walkthroughs
\item The \href{https://github.com/ropenscilabs/learngganimate}{learngganimate} project
by rOpenSci Labs includes a long range of detailed explorations of the
different gganimate functions
}
